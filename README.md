Hyperledger Fabric Assignment for Intership

 Problem Statement:
 Afinancial institution needs to implement a blockchain-based system to manage
 and track assets. The system should support creating assets, updating asset values,
 querying the world state to read assets, and retrieving asset transaction history. The
 assets represent accounts with specific attributes, such as DEALERID, MSISDN,
 MPIN, BALANCE, STATUS, TRANSAMOUNT, TRANSTYPE, and REMARKS.The
 institution aims to ensure the security, transparency, and immutability of asset
 records, while also providing an efficient way to track and manage asset-related
 transactions and histories.
